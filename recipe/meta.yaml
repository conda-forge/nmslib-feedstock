  patches:
    - patches/0001-remove-installation-requirements-handled-by-conda.patch
    # upstream has a cpu-guard that heckles people to compile from source if their
    # CPU supports more features than the library has been compiled with, see
    # https://github.com/nmslib/nmslib/blob/v2.1.1/python_bindings/tensorflow/cpu_feature_guard.cc#L158-L161
    # needless to say, we need to aim for portability here, and want to avoid
    # people following the instructions to install from pip, which might run
    # into various problems around ABIs of numpy/C++ etc.
    # Hopefully, we can provide more specific builds per CPU architecture
    # in the future, see conda-forge/conda-forge.github.io#1261
    - patches/0002-silence-log-that-tells-people-to-install-from-pip.patch
    # backport nmslib/nmslib#488 for compatibility with newer pybind11
    - patches/0003-Fix-import-on-newer-versions-of-pybind11-fixes-471.patch
    # some weird interaction with pybind11 + quote escapes on windows that
    # differs between python versions; 3.7 & 3.8 want backslashes, 3.9 doesn't
    - patches/0004-do-not-escape-quotes-for-VERSION_INFO.patch  # [py>=39]
